Chopstick
=========

Chopstick is a mobile-first responsive Design Framework.

## Install

First, `cd` into the project root (where this file is).

If this is the first time, run the following commands:

    gem update --system && gem install bundler
    bundle install
    bundle exec guard

Next time, just `cd` into the project root and `bundle exec guard`.

## Use

We try to keep the code as modular as possible. Simplified put, you can look at it this way:

    Shared Library + Settings = Theme

We have included a default theme that uses settings from the settings file + components from the shared library. You can remove the default theme and just use some components from the shared library, as you see fit. We donâ€™t like too much default generated code and neither should you.

For more information and examples please refer to the [documentation on our website](http://getchopstick.com/docs).

## Git subtree instructions

Chopstick (the scss folder) is included as a git subtree.

To push to the subtree: `git subtree push-all` or `git subtree push --prefix=scss`

To pull to the subtree: `git subtree pull-all` or `git subtree pull --prefix=scss`

The location and branch of the subtree are defined in the `.gittrees` file.

## Credits

We owe a ton of credits to the following projects for inspiration:

* Boilerplate
* Foundation and Bootstrap
* Semantic Grid System
* SMACSS
