Chopstick
=========

Chopstick is a mobile-first responsive Design Framework, initiated by [Wijs](http://wijs.be) in Ghent, Belgium.

## Install

You can use GUI tool like [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/). If you prefer the command line, you can install Sass. Then simply use `sass --watch scss:css` and start designing.

## Use

We try to keep the code as modular as possible. Simplified put, you can look at it this way:

    Shared Library + Settings = Theme

We have included a default theme that uses settings from the settings file + components from the shared library. You can remove the default theme and just use some components from the shared library, as you see fit. We donâ€™t like too much default generated code and neither should you.

For more information and examples please refer to the [documentation on our website](http://getchopstick.com/docs).
