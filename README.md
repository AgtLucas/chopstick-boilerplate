Chopstick
=========

Chopstick is a mobile-first responsive Design Framework, initiated by [Wijs](http://wijs.be) in Ghent, Belgium.

## Install

Make sure you [install compass](http://compass-style.org/install). Then simply use `compass watch` from a terminal and start making changes. Optionally, you can use [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/).

## Use

Using Chopstick is easy and light-weight. We try to keep the code as modular as possible. Simply put, you can look at it this way:

    Shared Library + Settings = Theme

The default theme uses settings from the settings file + components from the shared library. You can remove the entire theme and just use some components from the shared library, as you see fit. We donâ€™t like too much default generated code and neither should you.

For more information and examples please refer to the [documentation on our website](http://getchopstick.com/docs).
